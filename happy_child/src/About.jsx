                It's rather unfurtunate that the world we live in has resolved to making money out of the ribs of little kids rather actually helping them.
                Numerous organizations out there claiming to better the lives if people but end up squandering the support they get in reckless ways .
                <br/>
                <br/>
                We thought it wise to build a platform for those who want to help children but have not found a reliable or trustworthy means yet.
                <br/>
                We'll not need you to pass through us. Hence, eliminating ambiguity. 
                We only serve as a link between you and a happy child.
